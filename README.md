Use only gmail account that contains no valuable information for testing.  
  
Currently you can login to gmail account and program prints messages from inbox.   
Need to implement two more data classes so I can display list of folders in TableView and then one email in Webview.  
Send email is currently useless but will be rewritten when i make a new view for sending emails. you can send a test mail if you set accountdetails in file.  
Todo:  
Display all folders in account in treeview / display all messages in selected folder in tableview / display one email in webview.  
Write tests and documentation.  
New email view.  
Persistence.  
Settings view with persistence.  


Tests and documentation are abit behind.
